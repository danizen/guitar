### Pentatonic scale box patterns

Make up flash cards combining the following type of scale:
* Major, Minor, or Blues - Blues
* Key - A
* Position - 5th fret

On the back of the flash card, put the appropriate pentatonic scale.

### Sleeper's Awake

Work on the ornamentation and last page - do one Zuki bead session and the whole thing once

### Red-Haired Boy/Cold Frosty Morn - Al Petteway arrangement

Break it down and do Zuki beads on each four measure slice, to build speed

## Update

Went into a mode for a bit where I broke down Christopher Parkening's arrangement of Sleeper's Awake with Zuki beads and played it again and again and again.
