Guitar practice diary in Markdown files

## Goals

- Keep myself honest by tracking my practice
- Focus by writing down what I'm doing each week

## Technology

Yet I've already been a bit distracted into technology.   There's a [Unicode Musical Notation](http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D100.pdf) page.   Wouldn't it be great to be able to enter strumming patterns in that?   Apparently, I'd need a [custom keyboard layout](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665.aspx) to make progress with that.  There may be a markdown variant that works, but how then could I keep these notes in a github account.   Not sure how to make a Gnome keyboard layout, but there is also an [online keyboard layout editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/).

[Creating a keyboard layout](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Custom%20keyboard%20layout%20definitions?action=show&redirect=Howto%3A+Custom+keyboard+layout+definitions) on Ubuntu is another way to go.
